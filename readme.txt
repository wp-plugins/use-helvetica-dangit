Nobody should have to look at Arial.

== Description ==

<del>WordPress 3.2 uses Arial in the admin, marring an otherwise beautiful design. Use Helvetica instead instead of its bastard offspring.</del>

WordPress 3.2.1 introduced [a patch](http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/18020) that uses the `sans-serif` keyword. This plugin is thankfully no longer necessary.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will this plugin remove Arial from the WordPress admin area? =

<del>Yes.</del> It's no longer there to remove. Unless you're on Windows, but a WordPress plugin can't fix that for you.

= Can you also remove the scourge of Arial from the rest of the Internet? =

If only I could. Be the change you want to see in the world.

= I don't see the plugin listed =

If you're on a Multisite Network, activate this plugin across the network in the Network admin area so that all of your users can bask in the glow of improved typography.

== Changelog ==

= 1.0.1 =
* Make plugin useless, as Arial is blessedly gone in WP 3.2.1

= 1.0 =
* Initial release.
